Note App - Backend API
Project Overview

This project is a backend API for a simple note-taking app where users can create and manage their personal notes. Similar to a To-Do List, users can add notes and mark them as complete (true) or incomplete (false). By default, notes are incomplete, and users can toggle their status using the updateNote API.
